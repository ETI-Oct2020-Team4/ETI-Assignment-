# Software Methodology Considerations: 

# WaterFall :
- Pros: 
- The linear nature of the waterfall development method makes it easy to understand and manage. 
- Projects with clear objectives and stable requirements can best use the waterfall method. 
- Less experienced project managers and project teams, as well as teams whose composition changes frequently, may benefit the most from using the waterfall development methodology.

- Cons:
- The waterfall development method is often slow and costly due to its rigid structure and tight controls. 
- Many times not as responsive to changes 
- These drawbacks can lead waterfall method users to explore other software development methodologies.

# Agile:

- Pros:
- The primary benefit of agile software development is that it allows software to be released in iterations. 
- Iterative releases improve efficiency by allowing teams to find and fix defects and align expectation early on. 
- They also allow users to realize software benefits earlier, with frequent incremental improvements.

- Cons:
- Agile development methods rely on real-time communication, so new users often lack the documentation they need to get up to speed. 
- They require a huge time commitment from users and are labor intensive because developers must fully complete each feature within each iteration for user approval.

# Spiral
- Pros:
- Additional functionality or changes can be done at a later stage
- Cost estimation becomes easy as the prototype building is done in small fragments
- Continuous or repeated development helps in risk management
- Development is fast and features are added in a systematic way
- There is always a space for customer feedback


- Cons:
- Risk of not meeting the schedule or budget
- It works best for large projects only also demands risk assessment expertise
- For its smooth operation spiral model protocol needs to be followed strictly
- Documentation is more as it has intermediate phases
- It is not advisable for smaller project, it might cost them a lot

# Rapid Application Development:
- Pros:
- Rapid application development is most effective for projects with a well-defined business objective and a clearly defined user group, but which are not computationally complex. 
- RAD is especially useful for small to medium projects that are time sensitive.

- Cons:
- Rapid application development requires a stable team composition with highly skilled developers and users who are deeply knowledgeable about the application area. 
- Deep knowledge is essential in a condensed development timeline that requires approval after each construction phase. 
- Organizations that donâ€™t meet these requirements are unlikely to benefit from RAD.

# Chosen Methodology: 
- Agile + DevOps

- Why?
- Faster Development 
- Close communication with Client, Responds to changes
- Release in iterative, Easier to maintain for a small project
- Most Task can be automated , save quite a bit of time
